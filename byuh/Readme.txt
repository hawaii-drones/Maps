Here is all the code i have so that we can start coming togther to work on it.
For consistency please use the BLANK TEMPLATE.html for your section 
and insert the code in the middle section where the comment goes.
The interface needs to be worked on, i am going to work on a bootstrap version
I think it may give us more control and be able to have more responsiveness
but for not we can just update our current app and talk more about this 
after friday.

Here i will just note the main problems of the interface and anyone who wants can take a look
1.Google custom search, links are not clickable and seem to be hidden.
2.Google custom search loads after everything causing some items to be hidden
3.Smaller header and footer sections.

also i have noted that sometimes the intel XDK does not show some of the features unless you run
your program in full or in debugging mode.
